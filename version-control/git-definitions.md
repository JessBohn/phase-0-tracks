# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized. It is very useful for organization and to reduce mistakes by having everyone working on the base code at the same time

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is basically a copy of your project to work on. You would use a branch so that you could work on the project without making direct changes to the base code in case there are any errors

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically a save point for your project. A good message is specific and details what changes have been made since the last commmit

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is where your working directory has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you're trying to check out, therefore Git will not let you switch branches
