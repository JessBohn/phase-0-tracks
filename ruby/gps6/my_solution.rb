# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# This command allows the current file to reference the information
  # inside the file name given. 
# require_relative is to simplify the general require for a file within
# the same directory as the file you are working on. To use only require
# you must use the absolute file path

# Reflection Section

# - What are the differences between the two hash syntaxes shown
#   in the state_data file?

#   The differences is that the first set of keys and values are
#   set using the => syntax whereas the nested hash with the state
#   information in it uses the symbol syntax with the colon after 
#   the symbol name to set the key(symbol) and value pairs

# - What does the require_relative do? How is it different from
  # require?

  # require_relative allows the current file to reference the information
  # inside another file which is defined in '' after the require_relative
  # command using the name of the file that you want to reference 
  # require_relative is to simplify the general command require for a file within
  # the same directory as the file you are working on. To use only require
  # you must use the absolute file path

# - What are some ways to iterate through a hash?

  # You can use .each to iterate through each key-value pair
    # in a hash. You also use each_pair for every pair, each_key
    # for every key in the hash, or each_value to go through each
    # value of the hash.

# - When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about
#   the variables, if anything?

  # When I examined the variables I realized that since each of the
  # variables needed as parameters was already set to an instance
  # variable during initialize that we shouldn't (and don't) need to
  # collect them as parameters again for each of the methods inside
  # of virus_effects. Therefore nealizing that we didn't need those
  # arguments and removed them from the method calls, also removing
  # the parameters from both of the methods' definitions.

# - What concept did you mostly solidify in this challenge?

  # Honestly, this challenge mostly helped me realize that I 
  # already understood a lot of what we needed to do. Reading through
  # the code I could pretty much identify what everything was
  # to do and how it all worked together. This challenge did help
  # me a little bit with identifying areas where refactoring 
  # could be done to make the code more dry.
