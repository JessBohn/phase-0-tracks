# I will be writing an application for a pet sitter

# Must implement all important questions 
	# Name
	# Age
	# Address
	# All-time favorite animal
	# How many pets do they have
	# What kind of pets do they have
	# Have they ever watched someone else's pet
	# End - whether they can be my pet sitter or not
