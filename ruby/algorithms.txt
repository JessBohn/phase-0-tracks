How to Use an Elevator
- Walk up to the elevator
- Locate the up/down arrow buttons
	- Ask which floor the robot needs to go to
	- Calculate whether the robot needs to push the up or the down arrow
		- Use current floor (initial floor = 0) and floor needed to calculate
		- If floor needed - current floor is < 0
			- Push down arrow
		- If floor needed - current floor > 0
			- push up arrow
		- Else
			Ask again
- Wait patiently until elevator arrives
- Once doors open walk straight into elevator
- Locate the floor buttons
 	- Push the number eqivalent to the floor needed
- Ride the elevator until the floor counter reaches your desired floor
	- When other people are in the elevator do not leave the elevator until
		your floor number has been reached
- Wait for the doors to open
- Walk straight out onto your desired floor!
