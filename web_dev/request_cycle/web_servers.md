What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

  - Small is beautiful
  - Each program does one thing well
  - store data in flat text files
  - avoid captive user interfaces

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
  
  A VPS is a virtual machine that runs a copy of an operating system with "super-level" user privileges where the VPS' specified user can install pretty much any software onto the VPS. These are sold to the user by an internet hosting service. 

  Advantages: 
  - VPS are much less expensive than actual dedicated servers
  - Security: Each website gets its own os and resources, thus making it hard for another server to invade the security
  - Segregation: Each VPS is segregated from other servers on the same platform and there is no direct effect of another server's activity and customization.
  - Performance: The performance is a little lower than that of an actual dedicated server, but much higher than the shared server since it has designated amounts of resources in terms of CPU usage, memory and RAM.

* Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
  If you run programs as the root user in Linux it will/can change the entire system, i.e. all of the files and information anyone in the system, whcih is not the case when running programs from a user account.
