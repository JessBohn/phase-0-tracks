jquery notes

1. Download jquery
2. Explore its documents
3. Read 3 pages found on jquery
4. Look for 3 jquery 'cheat sheets'
5. Test out at least 5 different functions
  - Add event listener clicking 
  - Remove CSS class in response to event
  - Make element transition to invisible
  - Grab information from form
  - 1 other function
6. Answer following questions from release 0
  - What sort of resources will help?
  - How often should you stop and test what you just learned?
  - Are breaks important?

Actually, for me the easiest way to learn is to watch videos of people using jquery. I have a pretty good memory and once I watch the video show me what a specific method or whatever does, I can recall the correlation later on without (or with very little) time spent looking up the method and its description. I find that reading plain pages that explain to me in words what is going on is less helpful to me, unless it contains a graphic example. I get bored very easily with lots of text. Haha. You should periodically (every couple minutes in my case) stop and test what you have learned. The videos I watched had the user constantly testing new functions to show you a lot of the different things jquery can do so I learned a lot quickly. However, if you are using a resource that only has text examples and explanations you may wait longer between testing sessions. I'm not really sure what the question "are breaks important?" is referring to. If you're talking about personally when writing and testing code, yes. You should periodically give your brain a break so that it can process everything that you have learned/done so far. If its in reference to line breaks in code when using jquery and other similar things, the answer is still yes. This helps make your code more readable and its easier to find mistakes in the code.
